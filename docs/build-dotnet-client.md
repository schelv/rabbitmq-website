# Build RabbitMQ .NET Client from Source

## Overview {#overview}

This guides describes the process of building the .NET client library from source.

The repository is hosted on GitHub. Clone it with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client.git
```


## Required Libraries and Tools {#prerequisites}

To build the .NET/C# client libraries on Windows, you will need

 * .NET Core or Microsoft .NET 4.6.1 or later
 * Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 or later


## Building from Source {#building}

### On Windows with Visual Studio {#building-on-windows-with-vs}

To build the client with Visual Studio, first run

```powershell
build.bat
```

in repository root.
This will perform the required code generation as well as building a release version of the library.

Then

 * Open <code>RabbitMQDotNetClient.sln</code> in Visual Studio.
 * Build the solution.

### On Windows without Visual Studio {#building-on-windows-no-vs}

To build the client without Visual Studio, run

```powershell
build.bat
```

in repository root.
This will perform the required code generation as well as building a release version of the library.


## On Linux and MacOS {#building-on-linux}

The library can be built on Linux and MacOS using .NET Core 2.

Run

```bash
build.sh
```

This will perform the required
code generation as well as building a release version of the library.
