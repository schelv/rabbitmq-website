# Standalone MacOS Build

## Overview {#overview}

RabbitMQ releases used to include a special binary package for macOS that bundled
a supported version of Erlang/OTP. As of September 2019, this package has been discontinued.
It will no longer be produced for new RabbitMQ releases.

macOS users should use the [Homebrew formula](./install-homebrew)
or the [generic binary build](./install-generic-unix) (requires a [supported version of Erlang](./which-erlang)
to be installed separately) to provision RabbitMQ.
