# Supported Platforms

Our goal is for RabbitMQ to run on as wide a range of platforms as
possible. RabbitMQ can potentially run on any platform that provides
[a supported Erlang version](./which-erlang), from multi-core nodes and cloud-based
deployments to embedded systems.

The following platforms are supported by Erlang and could therefore
run RabbitMQ:

 * Linux
 * Windows versions supported by Microsoft, e.g. 10
 * Windows Server versions supported by Microsoft, e.g. Windows Server 2019
 * macOS
 * Solaris
 * FreeBSD

The open source release of RabbitMQ is most commonly used and deployed on the
following platforms:

 * [Ubuntu and Debian-based](./install-debian) Linux distributions
 * [Fedora, RHEL, CentOS and RPM-based](./install-rpm) Linux distributions
 * [Windows Server](./install-windows)
 * [macOS](./install-generic-unix)
 * openSUSE Leap


## Commercially Supported Platforms {#commercial-support}

A list of platforms for which you can purchase commercial support for
RabbitMQ is available in the [Open Source RabbitMQ Support by VMware page](https://tanzu.vmware.com/rabbitmq/oss).


## Windows {#windows}

RabbitMQ will run on any Windows version that [supported Erlang/OTP releases](./which-erlang)
can run on, both desktop and server editions. This includes Windows 10, Server 2012 through 2022.


## Other Flavours of UNIX {#bsd}

While not officially supported, Erlang and hence RabbitMQ can run on most
systems with a POSIX layer including FreeBSD, Solaris, NetBSD, OpenBSD
and many more.


## Virtualized Platforms and Containers {#virtualization}

RabbitMQ can run on physical or virtual hardware, including many
IaaS providers and containers. This also allows unsupported platforms that are
able to emulate a supported platform to run RabbitMQ.

A number of companies offer RabbitMQ-as-a-service in multiple clouds. Please see  [Installation Guide](./download)
to learn more.


## Unsupported Platforms {#unsupport}

Some platforms are not supported and probably never will be:

 * z/OS and most mainframes
 * Very memory-constrained systems (&lt; 32 MB of RAM)

If your platform is on this list or you need assistance then
please [contact VMware](./contact).
