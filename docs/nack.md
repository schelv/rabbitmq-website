# Negative Acknowledgements

## Overview {#overview}

Consumers in AMQP 0-9-1 can choose to use [manual acknowledgements](./confirms)
of deliveries.

The [AMQP 0-9-1 specification](./specification) defines the `basic.reject`
method that allows clients to reject individual, delivered
messages, instructing the broker to either discard them or
requeue them. Unfortunately, `basic.reject`
provides no support for negatively acknowledging messages in
bulk.

To solve this, RabbitMQ supports the `basic.nack`
method that provides all the functionality of
`basic.reject` whilst also allowing for bulk
processing of messages.


## Usage {#usage}

To reject messages in bulk, clients set the `multiple` flag of the `basic.nack`
method to `true`. The broker will then reject all
unacknowledged, delivered messages up to and including the
message specified in the `delivery_tag` field of the `basic.nack` method. In this respect,
`basic.nack` complements the bulk acknowledgement semantics of `basic.ack`.

Negative acknowledgements work for both [long running consumers](./consumers)
and polling-based ones (that use `basic.get`).

When a message is requeued, it will be placed to its original
position in its queue, if possible. If not (due to concurrent
deliveries and acknowledgements from other consumers when
multiple consumers share a queue), the message will be requeued
to a position closer to queue head.

## Examples {#examples}

### Java {#java-examples}

This Java client example rejects a single message consumed via polling (`basic.get`),
asking the broker to requeue it:

```java
GetResponse gr = channel.basicGet("some.queue", false);
channel.basicNack(gr.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), false, true);
```

This example rejects two messages with a single call to
the broker (the second argument on
`basicNack` is the `multiple` flag):

```java
GetResponse gr1 = channel.basicGet("some.queue", false);
GetResponse gr2 = channel.basicGet("some.queue", false);
channel.basicNack(gr2.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag(), true, true);
```
