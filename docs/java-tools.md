# Java Tools

This page documents some Java-based utility programs (PerfTest, Tracer).

## PerfTest {#load-testing}

RabbitMQ has a throughput testing tool, PerfTest, that is based on the Java client and can be
configured to simulate basic and advanced workloads as well.

PerfTest documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages:

 * For [the latest stable release](https://perftest.rabbitmq.com/)
 * For [the latest milestone release](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-perf-test/milestone/htmlsingle/)
 * For [the latest development build](https://perftest-dev.rabbitmq.com/)

## PerfTest for Streams (RabbitMQ Stream Protocol) {#stream-load-testing}

There is a separate version of PerfTest for streams that uses [RabbitMQ Stream Protocol](./stream) internally.

Its documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages:

 * For [the latest stable release](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/stable/htmlsingle/#the-performance-tool)


## Tracer {#tracer}

The tracer is a very basic, very simple AMQP 0-9-1 protocol analyzer, similar in
purpose to [Wireshark](./amqp-wireshark).
Use it with the `runtracer` or `runtracer.bat` script:

```bash
runtracer [proxy-port] [upstream-host] [upstream-port]
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <td>Parameter</td>
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Default value</td>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>proxy-port</td>
    <td>port to listen for incoming client connections on</td>
    <td>5673</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>upstream-host</td>
    <td>hostname to use when making an outbound connection in response to an incoming connection</td>
    <td>localhost</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>upstream-port</td>
    <td>port number to use when making an outbound connection</td>
    <td>5672</td>
  </tr>
</table>
