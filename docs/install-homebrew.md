# The Homebrew RabbitMQ Formula

## Overview {#overview}

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager for macOS and Linux.
A [RabbitMQ formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/r/rabbitmq.rb) is available from
Homebrews core tap (out of the box). The formula maintained by Homebrew community and not Team RabbitMQ.

A recent [supported Erlang/OTP version](./which-erlang) will be installed as a dependency.

Please **read this short guide** from start to finish. The formula is has its caveats,
some of which may render a node unupgradable to [RabbitMQ 3.12 and later versions](./upgrade)
because of disabled stable [feature flags](./feature-flags).


## Installation {#installation}

Before installing make sure the taps are up-to-date:

```bash
brew update
```

Then, install RabbitMQ server with:

```bash
brew install rabbitmq
```

Installing the RabbitMQ formula will install key dependencies such as a [supported Erlang/OTP version](./which-erlang).

However, installing the formula **will not start the service** (a RabbitMQ node). See [Running and Managing the Node](#managing-node)
below.


## Locations {#locations}

Both RabbitMQ server scripts and [CLI tools](./cli) are installed into the `sbin` directory under `/usr/local/Cellar/rabbitmq/{version}/`
for Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/rabbitmq/{version}/` for Apple Silicon Macs.

They should be accessible from `/usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/sbin` for for Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin` for Apple Silicon Macs.
Links to binaries have been created under `/usr/local/sbin` for Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/sbin` for Apple Silicon ones.

To find out locations for your installation, use:

```bash
brew info rabbitmq
```


## Effective OS User {#user}

With Homebrew, the node and CLI tools will use the logged in user OS account by default. This is optimal
for development environments and means that the same [shared secret file](./cli#authentication) is used by
both RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools.


## Running and Managing the Node {#managing-node}

Unlike some other installation methods, namely the [Debian](./install-debian) and [RPM packages](./install-rpm), RabbitMQ
Homebrew formula uses [generic UNIX binary builds](./install-generic-unix) and does not require `sudo`.

### Starting the Server

#### Starting a Node In the Foreground

To start a node in the foreground, run:

```bash
CONF_ENV_FILE="/opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf" /opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-server
```

After starting a node, we recommend enabling all feature flags on it:

```bash
# highly recommended: enable all feature flags on the running node
/opt/homebrew/sbin/rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag all
```

#### Starting a Node In the Background

To start a node in the background, use `brew services start`:

```bash
# starts a local RabbitMQ node
brew services start rabbitmq

# highly recommended: enable all feature flags on the running node
/opt/homebrew/sbin/rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag all
```

### Stopping the Server

To stop a running node, use:

```bash
# stops the locally running RabbitMQ node
brew services stop rabbitmq
```

or CLI tools directly:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/sbin/rabbitmqctl shutdown
```bash

The command will wait for the node process to stop. If the target node is not running,
it will exit with a warning.


## Using RabbitMQ CLI Tools with Homebrew {#cli}

The formula sets up links to CLI tools under `/usr/local/sbin` for Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/sbin` for Apple Silicon Macs.

In case that directory is not in `PATH`, it is recommended to append it:

```bash
# for macOS Intel
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
# for Apple Silicon
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/sbin
```

Add the above export to the shell profile (such as `~/.bashrc` for bash or `~/.zshrc` for zsh)
to have `PATH` updated for every new shell, including OS restarts.


## Enabling Feature Flags {#feature-flags}

The Homebrew formula does not enable [feature flags](./feature-flags) after installation. To enable
all feature flags after installation (this is **very important** both to get access to certain features and for future release compatibility),
use

```bash
/opt/homebrew/sbin/rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag all
```


## Configuring a Homebrew-installed RabbitMQ Node {#configure}

File and directory locations used by Homebrew differ from Intel Macs to Apple Silicon ones.
To find out locations for your installation, use:

```bash
brew info rabbitmq
```

On Apple Silicon Macs, [RabbitMQ configuration file](./configure#configuration-files) located at `/opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`.
The file does not exist by default and **must be created by the user**. The node then
must be restarted so that it picks up the new configuration file on boot.

It is possible to [use environment variables](./configure#customise-environment) to control certain settings.
`rabbitmq-env.conf` is located at `/opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf`

See RabbitMQ [configuration guide](./configure) to learn more.


## Reinstalling the Formula {#reinstall}

To reinstall the formula, for example, if an older installation
cannot be upgraded because it [did not proactively enable all feature flags](./upgrade),
uninstall it, then remove all node data files:

```bash
brew services stop rabbitmq

brew uninstall rabbitmq

# Now delete all node's data directories and configuration files.
# This assumes that Homebrew root is at /opt/homebrew
rm -rf /opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/
rm -rf /opt/homebrew/opt/rabbitmq/
rm -rf /opt/homebrew/var/lib/rabbitmq/
# the launch agent file
rm -f $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rabbitmq.plist

# re-install
brew install rabbitmq

## start the service if necessary
# brew services start rabbitmq

## after starting the service, enable all feature flags
# /opt/homebrew/sbin/rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag all
```
