# Memory and Disk Alarms

## Overview {#overview}

During operation, RabbitMQ nodes will consume varying amount of [memory](./memory-use) and disk
space based on the workload. When usage spikes, both memory and free disk space can reach
potentially dangerous levels. In case of memory, the node can be killed
by the operating system's low-on-memory process termination mechanism
(known as the "OOM killer" on Linux, for example). In case of free disk space,
the node can run out of memory, which means it won't be able to perform
many internal operations.

To reduce the likelihood of these scenarios, RabbitMQ has two configurable resource
watermarks. When they are reached, RabbitMQ will block connections that publish messages.

More specifically, RabbitMQ will block connections that
publish messages in order to avoid being killed by the
OS (out-of-memory killer) or exhausting all available free disk space:

 * When [memory use](./memory-use) goes above the configured watermark (limit)
 * When [free disk space](./disk-alarms) drops below the configured watermark (limit)

Nodes will temporarily _block_ publishing connections
by suspending reading from [client connection](./connections).
Connections that are only used to *consume* messages will not be blocked.

Connection [heartbeat monitoring](./heartbeats) will be deactivated, too.
All network connections will show in `rabbitmqctl` and the
management UI as either `blocking`, meaning they
have not attempted to publish and can thus continue, or
`blocked`, meaning they have published and are now
paused. Compatible clients will be [notified](#client-notifications)
when they are blocked.

Connections that only consume are not blocked by resource alarms; deliveries
to them continue as usual.


## Client Notifications {#client-notifications}

Modern client libraries support [connection.blocked notification](./connection-blocked)
(a protocol extension), so applications can monitor when they are blocked.


## Alarms in Clusters {#effects-on-clusters}

When running RabbitMQ in a cluster, the memory and disk alarms
are cluster-wide; if one node goes over the limit then all nodes
will block connections.

The intent here is to stop producers but let consumers continue
unaffected. However, since the protocol permits producers and consumers
to operate on the same channel, and on different channels of a
single connection, this logic is necessarily imperfect. In
practice that does not pose any problems for most applications
since the throttling is observable merely as a
delay. Nevertheless, other design considerations permitting, it
is advisable to only use individual connections for either
producing or consuming.


## Effects on Data Safety {#data-safety}

When an alarm is in effect, publishing connections will be blocked by TCP back pressure.
In practice this means that publish operations will eventually time out of fail outright.
Application developers must be prepared to handle such failures and use [publisher confirms](./confirms)
to keep track of what messages have been successfully handled and processed by RabbitMQ.


## Running Out of File Descriptors {#file-descriptors}

When the server is close to using all the file descriptors
that the OS has made available to it, it will refuse client
connections. See [Networking guide](./networking) to learn more.


## Transient Flow Control {#transient-flow-control}

When clients attempt to publish faster than the server can
accept their messages, they go into transient [flow control](./flow-control).
